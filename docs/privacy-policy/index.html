Some of our services, and certain pages of the ResoNova Site, are available only

networks connected to any ResoNova Site or service, through hacking, password 
mining or any other means. You may not screen-scrape, data scrape and/or use any
automated means to acquire data and/or information from our Sites. You agree 
that you will not engage in any activities related to any ResoNova Site that are
contrary to these Terms of Service and/or any applicable laws or regulations. 
You agree to notify us immediately in the event that you learn or suspect that 
the security of your password may have been compromised. You further agree that 
you are responsible for any unauthorized use of your password that is made 
before you have notified us and we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on 
that notice. We reserve the right to suspend or cancel your password, even 
without receiving such notice from you, if we suspect that it is being used in 
an unauthorized or fraudulent manner.

Notwithstanding the above, you are responsible for monitoring your use of the 
ResoNova Sites and should promptly report any unauthorized or suspicious 
activity to us at novx@resonova.com.

CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT

Copyright Complaints: ResoNova respects the intellectual property of others, and
we ask our users to do the same. If you believe that your work has been copied 
in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that your intellectual 
property rights have been otherwise violated, you should notify ResoNova in 
accordance with the procedure set forth below.

ResoNova will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will 
take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and
other applicable intellectual property laws with respect to any alleged or 
actual infringement. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be 
sent to: novx@resonova.com.

To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following 
information:

    1. An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on 
       behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property 
       interest.

    2. A description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that
       you claim has been infringed.

    3. A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is 
       located on a ResoNova Site, with enough detail that we may find it on a 
       ResoNova Site.

    4. Your address, telephone number, and email address.

    5. A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed 
       use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, 
       its agent, or the law.

    6. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above 
       information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or 
       intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or 
       intellectual property owner’s behalf.

SECURITIES PRODUCTS

None of the information contained in the publicly accessible portions of the 
ResoNova Sites constitutes a recommendation, solicitation or offer by ResoNova 
or its affiliates to buy or sell any securities, futures, options or other 
financial instruments or other assets or provide any investment advice or 
service. The information contained in the ResoNova Sites has been prepared 
without reference to any particular user’s investment requirements or financial 
situation. The information and services provided on the ResoNova Sites are not 
provided to, and may not be used by, any person or entity in any jurisdiction 
where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable laws, rules 
or regulations of any governmental authority or regulatory or self-regulatory 
organization or clearing organization or where ResoNova is not authorized to 
provide such information or services. Some products and services described in 
the ResoNova Sites may not be available in all jurisdictions or to all clients.

INDEMNITY AND RELEASE

You agree to release, indemnify and hold ResoNova harmless from any from any and
all losses, damages, expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, rights, 
claims, actions of any kind and injury (including death) arising out of or 
relating to your use of the ResoNova Sites. If you are a California resident, 
you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release 
does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist 
in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must 
have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident 
of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.

CHOICE OF LAW

The Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with
the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to conflicts of laws 
provisions. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by you and us, any dispute 
arising out of or relating to the Agreement, or the breach hereof, shall be 
finally resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration 
Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, or such arbitration body as 
required by law, rule or regulation, and judgment upon the award rendered by the
arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration will
be conducted in the English language before a single arbitrator in the City of 
Atlanta, Georgia. Such arbitration must be commenced within one (1) year after 
the claim or cause of action arises. If for any reason any provision of this 
Agreement, or a portion thereof, shall be unenforceable, that provision shall be
enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of this 
Agreement, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and 
effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us and you with 
respect to this site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous 
communications, agreements and understandings between ResoNova and you with 
respect to the subject matter hereof. A printed version of this Agreement shall 
be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings.
